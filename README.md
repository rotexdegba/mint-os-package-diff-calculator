# What are the packages I have installed after the intial installation of Mint 18 Cinnamon Edition (64bits)

This is a simple script that prints out a list of packages that have been installed 
in a Mint 18 Cinnamon Edition (64bits) after the initial install of the OS; these are
packages other than the default packages that ship with a clean install of Mint 18 Cinnamon Edition (64bits).

It contains a python and php script that both do the same thing.

There is a file ( `data/installed-packages-in-vanilla-mint-18-64bits.txt` )
 containing a list of default packages contained in a fresh install
 of Mint 18 Cinnamon Edition (64bits). This file was generated by 
 running the command below on a machine running a fresh install
 of the OS.

 `dpkg --get-selections > ./data/installed-packages-in-vanilla-mint-18-64bits.txt`

 You can re-generate the file on a machine running a fresh install
 of the OS if you want to run this script for another flavor of the
 Mint OS or any other debian based OS.



## Usage:

Make the script executable by running: 

`chmod ug+x ./calc-diffs.py`

**OR**

`chmod ug+x ./calc-diffs.php`

Execute the script:

`./calc-diffs.py`

**OR**

`./calc-diffs.php`
